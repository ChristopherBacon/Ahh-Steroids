# Ahh-Steroids
Using Scikit-learn to classify potentially dangerous asteroids from NASA data.

# Data

1. [NASA asteroid data](nasa.csv) A spread sheet of nasa NEO object data that I used to test my models on.

# Approach

Testing a number of ML models from Scikit-learn to see which gives us potentially the best fit. This was my first ML learning project and I learnt alot, really enjoyable applying these techniques to an actual NASA dataset.
